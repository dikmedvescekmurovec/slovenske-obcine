# Slovenske Občine

An app to explore Slovenian municipalities and their unique crests, built with a focus on **vibe coding**.

## The Vibe Prompt

This entire README, and the application it describes, is a direct result of the following prompt:

```text
Write a readme.md for an app called Slovenske Obcine. It is an app to learn about slovenian municipalities and their crests.

It is an exercise in vibe coding. It should only contain AI generated code, with minimal exceptions. At least 99% should be AI. PRs with human written code will be rejected.

Hosting is done on netlify and deployment is automated. Commits on main branch trigger deployment.

App is hosted on [https://slovenskeobcine.netlify.app/](https://slovenskeobcine.netlify.app/)```

## About

Slovenske Občine is a playful exploration of Slovenia's local geography and heraldry. Discover the various municipalities that make up Slovenia and feast your eyes on their distinct symbols. This app is an exercise in **vibe coding**, pushing the boundaries of AI-assisted development.

## Vibe Coding Mandate

This project is a testament to the power of **vibe coding**. The core principle is simple: **at least 99% of the code in this repository must be generated by Artificial Intelligence.** Human written code is the 1%.

Pull requests containing significant amounts of human-written code will be respectfully closed. We're here to ride the AI wave and see where the vibes take us!

## Features

* Browse a list of Slovenian municipalities.
* View the crest associated with each municipality (where available).
* Learn basic information about each municipality.
* A delightful user interface, ideally vibed into existence by an AI.

## Deployment

This application is hosted on Netlify. Deployment is fully automated.

**Commits pushed to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.**

## Contributing

Feeling the vibe? Want to contribute to this AI-generated masterpiece?

1.  **Generate your code using your preferred AI coding assistant.**
2.  **Ensure your generated code adheres to the 99% AI rule.** (We're not strictly checking line by line, but the *spirit* of vibe coding should be maintained - significant, complex logic should originate from AI).
3.  Submit a pull request with your AI-generated contributions.

Let's see what incredible things the AI can build!
